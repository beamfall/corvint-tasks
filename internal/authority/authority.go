// Package authority supplies the explicit, mutation-only filesystem
// primitives of SPEC §3.4, §5.1 and §5.2 for the repository authority that
// internal/intent resolves: the bounded exclusive flock on
// `<git-common-dir>/taskman.lock`, filesystem qualification by actual OS
// observation, descriptor-based durable sync, and the exclusive
// link-in creation primitive used for `receipts/<seq>.json`, `.boot` and
// `.ack`.
//
// Nothing here is for reading. Every entry point opens for writing,
// creates, locks or syncs; a read verb (TM-V0-008) never calls this
// package. Repository identity comes only from intent.Resolve; this package
// invents no second notion of the common dir, the state dir or the lock.
//
// What a success here does NOT prove (see Prerequisites): a qualified local
// filesystem is not a caller authentication, a held lock is not an actor
// binding or ownership proof, and no capacity or escrow check exists. The
// §5.2 transaction writer is a separate slice; this package publishes single
// files exclusively and never sequences a transaction.
